Not much time to dedicate here so i will add some points here.

1- Get best clients i was getting in trouble so was easier for me to work with pure SQL.
2- Took a bit more time try to do all by using sequelize as recruiter suggest.
3- We could add tests with mocha, chai suppertest to simulate the endpoints call and test over there with a test sqlite database. Happy to do it if i had more time.
4- Added some libraries to express middlewares i am use to work with as helmet or wistong to better security and logs debug
5- For me it was first time working with app.set in express i prefer to use the singleton pattern and import it on services needed. Im happy to talk about it because im curious on it.
6- Pay function was used with transaction because i wass on the loop but maybe not necesary there.
7- I changed a bit project structure for models etc so i feel more confortable with.
8- Sorry for not dedicating the full time i would like but i think this is fair to start with, happy to talk :)

Thank you,
Sergio
